Files:

1. CodeBook.md a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data

2. run_analysis.R performs the data cleaning and tidying by performing the following steps:

> Merging the training and the test sets to create one data set.
> Extracting the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
> Using descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
> labelling the dataset with descriptive variable names.
> From the data set obtained in previous step, createing a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each       activity and each subject.
> tidy_data_avg.txt is the exported final data obtained after running the analysis.
